#There are two setup files in this drive:\
    1)FlatBsetup.exe and\
    2)FlatB_scrollbarsetup.exe,\
    Corresponding to the applications "FlatB" and "FlatB_scrollbar" respectively.

#The FlatB app does not have a scrollbar implemented in it and may cause an effect where\
    all the contents of the app might not show up on the users screen specifically if\
    the resolution of the users screen is less than 1080p.

#One workaround is that the user can reduce the scaling to 100% from 125%(default):\
    1)Go to the settings app on Windows.\
    2)Go under System\Display and look for "Scale and Layout".\
    3)Under the corresponding drop down menu select 100% instead of 125%.

    This should allow the user to view all of the content on full screen.

#Another way is to simply install the "FlatB_scrollbar" app which has a scrollbar implemented\
    to scroll up and down to view the content hidden due to scaling issues.
